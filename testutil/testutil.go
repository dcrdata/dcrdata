Package testutil provides convenience functions and types for testing.

Generally tests should be written in a way that helps easily to switch to any other test framework.
For example, this allows reusing test-checks by calling them from working prod code like assert calls.

testutil stands as a proxy between user-code and a test framework giving some flexibility on configuring test-setup.

Currently testutil wraps only the GO-Lang/testing framework
